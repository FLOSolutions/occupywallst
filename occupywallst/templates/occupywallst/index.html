      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        On the <strong>17th of September</strong>, AdBusters called
        for 20,000 people to flood into lower Manhattan, set up tents,
        kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street for a few
        months.  Once there, we shall incessantly repeat one simple
        demand in a plurality of voices.
      </p>
      <p>
        We draw inspiration from the popular assemblies in Egypt's
        Tahrir Square which have reminded us that <em>real</em> change
        is possible.  We call upon every American who's been betrayed
        by corruption and greed to join us in this event.  Let us
        follow the example of our Egyptian brothers and systers
        by <em>peacefully</em> occupying their streets and not going
        home until our demands have been met.
      </p>
      <p>
        The time has come to deploy this emerging stratagem
        against the greatest corrupter of our democracy: Wall
        Street, the financial Gomorrah of America.  It's time for
        <strong>DEMOCRACY NOT CORPORATOCRACY!</strong>
      </p>

        This website is meant to serve as a social network for
